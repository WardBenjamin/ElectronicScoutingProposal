# Electronic Scouting System Proposal

This is the LaTeX source for my Electronic Scouting System proposal for Chantilly Robotics (FRC 612).

Required packages:

 - titling
 - geometry
 - biblatex
 - graphicx
 - hyperref
 

###Building:

To build, you must have the `arara` and `biber` packages installed. Arara requires Java (See https://github.com/cereda/arara/ for information).

After these packages are installed, ElectronicScoutingSystemProposal.tex must be build with arara.
